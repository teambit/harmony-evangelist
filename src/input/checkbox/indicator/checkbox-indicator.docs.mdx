The native `<input/>` tag is difficult to style, so it is hidden (using the `<HiddenInput/>` component), and replaced visually with a `<Indicator/>` component.
The *indicator* is a `<span/>` element that mirrors the state of the *input* tag, showing checked/unchecked state, disabled state, and focus.

Default styles include the following attributes:
- checked / unchecked
- disabled
- focus

Uses the following colors:
- --bit-border-color - unchecked border.
- --bit-border-color-lightest - disabled unchecked 
- --bit-accent-bg - focus outline
- --bit-accent-color - checked
- --bit-accent-heavy - checked hover
- --bit-accent-bg-heavy - disabled checked
